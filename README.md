# Anime_track ## (This is a work in progress!)

## **What it is:** 
Anime_track is an application that gets information on upcoming and currently running japanese animations.

## **Why it exists:**
I am undertaking this project to gain experience building more complex code from scratch, to play around with python's tkinter,
and to easily keep track of upcoming animations.

## **How it's organized:**
This project has three main modules namely:

- *getData.py*: This python module contains the code that scrapes the anime website and organizes the data

- *ani_Objects.py*: This module contains the anime object class. It is meant to group the information associated 
with each animation into one object so that each animation is an object with it's own data.

- *app.py*: This module contains the code for the user interface of the app which is being built with tkinter.
